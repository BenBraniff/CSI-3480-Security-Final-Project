# CSI-3480-Security-Final-Project

Title: The Implications of AI in Security and Privacy in Computing


We plan to introduce how AI impacts security and privacy, then demonstrate a program that analyzes synthetic user data and generates likely passwords based on patterns. We will also discuss methods to address or mitigate these AI-related risks.


Our methodology includes creating fake profiles, extracting keywords, and generating password guesses, with the option to expand to larger datasets or more advanced logic.
